A "getting started" project for CIS 322, software engineering 1 at University of Oregon.




  Deployment should work "out of the box" with this command sequence: 
  ** git clone <yourGitRepository> <targetDirectory>
  ** cd <targetDirectory>
  ** make configure
  ** make run 
  ** (control-C to stop program)
  * Turn in the github or URL to your repository

  Simple web server only handles GET requests
  Returns text files in /pages folder
  Uses port 8000
  so in your brower type in "localhost:8000/"+ file name requested
  throws 403 errors if forbidden
  throws 404 errors if not found
  throws 200 status OK if file is found

  
### Who do I talk to? ###

* Use our Piazza group for questions. Make them public (anonymous or not as you prefer) unless you have a good reason to make them private, so that everyone benefits from answers and discussion.
